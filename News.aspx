            People don’t come to Vegas to recycle. They come to gamble. That’s why at Caesars all the garbage goes to one place - the docks that are at the same level as the casino floor. There, a team from Renu Oil sorts all the garbage into recyclable and non-recyclable.

           Caesars plans to roll out cork recycling to all Caesars properties in Las Vegas. Renu Oil has committed to adding cork to the collecting, sorting and recycling programs currently in place at our Las Vegas facilities. RenuOil handles everything from your typical plastic and card board recyclables, down to your more difficult-to-recycle items like textiles and organic waste. “We have teams staffed at each recycling dock with our sorting systems, covering every single shift to sort through the entire waste stream for that site,” explains Sophia Salas, Manager of Renu Oil. “It’s a very comprehensive program.”

            Obama announced last week financial backing for initiatives to make government properties
            energy efficient and to create tens of thousands of jobs in the entire process.
            Former president Bill Clinton and President Obama joined forces to announce government
            and private-sector commitments to create jobs in this economy by motivating ecological
            movements within the government. President Obama said Congress should facilitate
            tax incentives for institutions that undertake energy-efficiency projects. The best
            part of this incentive is that it does not use a single penny from taxpayer’s money,
            yet it will lower energy use and ultimately benefit taxpayers.

            In 2004, Isabell Ysassi and her husband, Todd House, started a recycling business in Las Vegas. Renu Oil of America not only recycled used cooking oil from kitchens along the Las Vegas Strip, it also handled more traditional recycling of trash. House had been an executive chef at the Flamingo; Ysassi was a cook and later a dealer. She remembers the first time he asked for her help with recycling the trash. She had already worked a full shift and was wearing a skirt and high heels. He took her to the docks behind one of the casinos and told her to roll up her sleeves. "It was so embarrassing." She thought helping run the business meant "I'm gonna do clerical or boss people around, tell them what to do." Instead he wanted her to pick through garbage to sort out cardboard, plastic and aluminum. "This is your company," he told her. "You're gonna help me with this."

                    Heating and cooling costs are always an issue in the Las Vegas Valley as our temperatures
                    differ so much throughout the year. Usually, energy wasting results from poor insulation,
                    lack of energy management or oversized A/C units. By enlisting the help of eco-friendly
                    methods, you can lower your heating and cooling costs. Rather than blasting A/C
                    units, include energy-efficient ceiling fans in the rooms used most frequently.
                    During the winter season, you can use a fireplace or wood-burning stove to alternate
                    with the reverse setting in your ceiling fans.
