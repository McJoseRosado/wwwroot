    <h3>
        Our Founder</h3>
    <p>
        The birth of our "Green” movement began in 1998 with our founder, Todd House. He understood the value and necessity of recycling programs and began his ecological efforts with the first oil filtration machine locally. Everyone that met Mr. House described him as one of the hardest working people they had encountered; he worked until his very last day on April 7th, 2008. His family stepped in to manage the business. Since then, the business has expanded to include various recycling programs and is aimed at improving the eco-quality of life for our society. Every day, RENUoil of America, Inc. operates in his memory.</p>
